					<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					<p>
						The idea for myLibrary came from the need to organize all of the
						books, articles and blog posts I had bought and saved over the
						years. I wanted to have one location I could search that would tell
						me where I kept the literature, physical or digital.
					</p>

				<div id="problem" class="project-section">
					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>
						Users do not have an easy way to keep track of all their reading
						material.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="users" class="project-section">
					<h2>Target Users</h2>
					<p>
						A typical user would be on the app to add their books and other
						reading materials, or to look up a previously added material to find
						the progress, page location, reviews and additional info.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="sketches" class="project-section">
					<h2>Sketches & Brainstorming</h2>
					<p>
						I began by laying out ideas for the home page, viewing more details,
						and the ability to add books and articles. I wanted users to be able
						to add their own notes to really personalize their collection.
					</p>
					<div>
						<img src="../../assets/Projects/library/sketches.png" alt="" />
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="wireframes" class="project-section">
					<h2>Wireframes</h2>
					<p>
						I cleaned up the sketches and moved to a digital format. This helped
						me visualize the app more accurately, while still allowing room for
						changes.
					</p>
					<div>
						<img src="../../assets/Projects/library/wireframe.png" alt="" />
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="mockups" class="project-section">
					<h2>Mockups</h2>
					<p>
						With a more concrete vision in mind for the app, I began creating
						the high-fidelity mockups. Some of the overall layout shifted, but
						more importantly, I was able to expand on a lot of the brainstorming
						I had done earlier.
					</p>

				<div id="conclusion" class="project-section">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						Overall I learned a lot from this project. If I were to redo this
						app I would probably do more research earlier in the process. A lot
						of the decisions I had made were already based on an idea I had for
						the design. I would also want to try and get more feedback or
						perform some usability tests to figure out what are some pain
						points.
