					<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					<p>
						The idea for Coffee Time came about when I was wanting to find a
						local coffee shop, but enjoyed the ease-of-use from Starbucks&apos;
						and Caribou&apos;s apps. With an app like this, everyone would be
						able to connect over their love of coffee and tea.
					</p>
					<div>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="problem" class="project-section">
					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>
						Users are limited to one coffee app per chain and don&apos;t have
						any apps for local coffee shops.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="users" class="project-section">
					<h2>Target Users</h2>
					<p>
						A typical user is likely going to be younger in age. They would be
						on the app to order drinks, see what other people are drinking,
						share recipes, and find shops.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="sketches" class="project-section">
					<h2>Sketches & Brainstorming</h2>
					<p>
						I was pretty loose and exploratory during my sketch phase. I roughly
						laid out a general idea of how I wanted the app to function and some
						of the main features I wanted to focus on, such as seeing profiles,
						messages and the main feed that would feature all of the drinks
						people were sharing.
					</p>

				<div id="wireframes" class="project-section">
					<h2>Wireframes</h2>
					<p>
						When I was building out the wireframes I got a better sense of
						spacing and layout. I also thought of featuring a drink from a
						specific local shop.
					</p>
					<div>

				</div>
				<div id="mockups" class="project-section">
					<h2>Mockups</h2>
					<p>
						With all of the layouts and features completed, I created the
						finalized mockups. These expanded upon the wireframes and helped
						show me areas I needed to adjust.

				<div id="conclusion" class="project-section">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						While I learned a lot from this project, it taught me the importance
						of planning a project as if I were the one developing it as well. I
						wasn&apos;t entirely sure at the time how all of these stores would
						connect and I think that would be one of the biggest challenges if I
						attempted to build this app. The other drawback from an app like
						this is people can already share drinks on the general social media
						apps, so I would have to be able to cater more towards folks that
						only want to see drinks and local coffee shops.
