				Welcome! Ever since I was young I have enjoyed building and creating
				things, so I went to school for Graphic Design and English. However, I
				felt something was missing. When I began my job at ARI Network Services
				in 2018 I became exposed to UX/UI Design and web development. This was
				when I took more of an interest in coding and began self-teaching HTML,
				CSS and Javascript. My progress was pretty slow until about 2022 when I
				started to take it more seriously and have been learning almost every
				day since. Learning to code has vastly increased my problem solving
				skills and the ability to learn on my own. One of the main reasons UX/UI
				design and programming interest me is the never-ending amount of things
				to learn. As I continue my journey I am excited to see how far I can
				push myself.
